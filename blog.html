                We believe that learning evolves through a two-way interaction between facilitators and students. Hence, our classroom sessions focus on collaborative learning, rather than a one-sided approach.
                 <br><br>
                Our teaching methodology is activity and project based. Our integrated curriculum is to have attitude and values along with scholastic and co-scholastic aptitudes.
